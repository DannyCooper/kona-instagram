1. Activate the Kona plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Get an Instagram Access Token: To do this login to instagram and [click here] (http://instagram.pixelunion.net/). Once you have a token, please paste it into the 'Instagram Access Token' setting.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My feed isn't showing? =

Please make sure to add your Instagram access token the block settings. Once added you're feed should show instantly (well pretty fast at least).

= How about X feature? =

We will continue adding features as requested. If you have a killer idea for a feature submit a support request and we will see what we can do.
Note: we plan to release a premium version of the plugin which will likely receive new features first - this helps offset the cost of our development time.

= The feed looks funny in IE9 (Or other old browser)

This plugin is laid out using the new CSS Grid specification, we do not have plans to support older browsers as we believe they are holding back the web. However we can (if requested) release some code which you can add to your site's custom css in order to support certain browsers.
